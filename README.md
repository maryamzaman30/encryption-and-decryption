## Associated with University of London

## Introduction 
This project contains two Python functions, `encrypt` and `decrypt`, which are used to encrypt and decrypt text using a simple substitution cipher. The encryption and decryption processes rely on a key to transform the plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.
